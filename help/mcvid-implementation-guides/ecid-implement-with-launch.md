## About Launch {#section-611711602854464ea351a4af80a8dafe}

[Launch, by Adobe](https://docs.adobelaunch.com/) is the next-generation of the Adobe tag-management capability that is built into the Adobe Experience Cloud. Launch enables clients to:

* Deploy client-side web products using integrations called extensions 
* Consistently capture, define, manage, and share data between marketing and advertising products from other vendors and from Adobe 
* Launch is an advanced JavaScript delivery system that evaluates conditions and executed actions to efficiently and effectively deploy client-side libraries and products. It provides a highly scalable approach to managing and building extensions, together with a robust set of APIs for programmatic interaction with the Adobe Experience Cloud.
