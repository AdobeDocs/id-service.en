# Get Region and User IDs From the AMCV Cookie or the ID Service {#get-region-and-user-ids-from-the-amcv-cookie-or-the-id-service}

The AMCV cookie contains the Experience Cloud ID (MID) and a region ID for your site visitors. These IDs are stored as key-value pairs. The mid:user ID holds the visitor's Experience Cloud ID. The aamlh:region ID holds the region ID for your site visitors. You can recover this information by parsing the AMCV cookie.

 For more information, see [Get User IDs and Regions Through the Experience Cloud ID Service](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/dcs-mcid-ids.html).

If you're an [!DNL Audience Manager] customer, you can get the region ID from the response sent by the Data Collection Server (DCS). See [Get User IDs and Regions from a DCS Response](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/dcs-aam-ids.html).

You can also get the region ID with a `GET` method provided by the ID service. See [Get Region IDs (Location Hint)](../library/get-set/mcvid-getlocationhint.md#reference-a761030ff06c4439946bb56febf42d4c).
