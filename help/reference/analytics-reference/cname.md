# CNAME implementation overview{#cname-implementation-overview}

CNAME implementations allow you to customize the collection domain used by Adobe so that they match your own domain. This allows Adobe to set first-party cookies on the server-side instead of the client-side using JavaScript. In the past, these server-side first-party cookies were not subject to limits imposed under Appleâ€™s Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) policy. However, in November 2020, [!DNL Apple] updated their policies so that these limitations were also applied to cookies set via CNAME. Currently, both cookies set on the server-side via CNAME and cookies set on the client-side via Javascript are limited to a seven-day or 24-hour expiry under ITP. For more information on the ITP policy, see this [!DNL Apple] document [on tracking prevention](https://webkit.org/tracking-prevention/#intelligent-tracking-prevention-itp).

While a CNAME implementation does not provide any benefits in terms of cookie lifetime, there may be some other benefits such as ad blockers and less common browsers preventing data from being sent to domains they classify as trackers. In those cases, using a CNAME may prevent your data collection from being disrupted for users employing these tools.
