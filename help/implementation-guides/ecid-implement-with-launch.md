## About Experience Platform tags {#section-611711602854464ea351a4af80a8dafe}

[Adobe Experience Platform tags](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/launch/using/home.html) is the next-generation of the Adobe tag-management capability that is built into the Adobe Experience Cloud. Platform tags enable clients to:

* Deploy client-side web products using integrations called _extensions_. 
* Consistently capture, define, manage, and share data between marketing and advertising products from other vendors and from Adobe.
* Platform tags are an advanced JavaScript delivery system that evaluates conditions and executed actions to efficiently and effectively deploy client-side libraries and products. Tags provide a highly scalable approach to managing and building extensions, together with a robust set of APIs for programmatic interaction with the Adobe Experience Cloud.
