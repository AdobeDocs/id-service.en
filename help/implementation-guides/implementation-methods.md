# Implementation methods

Instructions and code samples for standard and non-standard implementations of the Experience Cloud Identity Service.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Be sure to read and understand the [ID service requirements](../reference/requirements.md) before getting started with these procedures.

## Standard implementation {#section-ea1e5270f2184f85a2e85214a6ac60cb}

A standard implementation uses [!DNL Dyanamic Tag Manager] (DTM) to help you get started with the ID service and integrate it with other [!DNL Experience Cloud] solutions. We strongly recommend that you use DTM when implementing the ID service. To get started, see [Standard Implementation with DTM](../implementation-guides/standard.md#concept-89cd0199a9634fc48644f2d61e3d2445).

## Non-standard implementations {#section-2c4f2db1f9704315a7cccab6d2e07113}

These procedures and code samples can help you set up the [!DNL Experience Cloud] ID service in a manual, or non-standard manner. Please note that these implementations are often technically challenging and complex. They can require scarce engineering resources on your part or consume contracted support time with your Adobe consultant.

>[!TIP]
>
>As an alternative, we recommend using DTM to implement the ID service. DTM streamlines the implementation workflow and automatically ensures the correct code placement and sequencing. Additionally, DTM puts you on the recommended implementation path for the ID service and subsequent integrations with other Experience Cloud solutions.
