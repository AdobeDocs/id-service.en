[Adobe Experience Platform Launch](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/launch/using/home.html) makes it easy to configure and set up an opt in scenario with Adobe solutions. You can simplify gathering visitor opt-in consents for Experience Cloud solutions by enabling Analytics, Target, Audience Manager, and other or all select Experience Cloud solutions to opt in to your consent management system.

If the Experience Cloud ID extension is not yet installed, open your property, then click *Extensions* > *Catalog*, hover over the Experience Cloud ID extension and click *Install*.

To configure the extension, open the *Extensions* tab and hover over the extension. Then click *Configure*.
