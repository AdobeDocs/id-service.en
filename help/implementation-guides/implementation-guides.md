# Implementation guides

Instructions and code samples for standard and non-standard implementations of the Experience Platform Identity Service.

Important: Be sure to read and understand the ID service requirements before getting started with these procedures.

## Standard implementation

A standard implementation uses [Adobe Exprience Platform Launch](https://docs.adobelaunch.com/) to help you get started with the ID service and integrate it with other Experience Cloud solutions. We strongly recommend that you use Experience Platform Launch when implementing the ID service.
