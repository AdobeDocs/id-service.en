# Implementation guides

Instructions and code samples for standard and non-standard implementations of the Experience Cloud Identity Service.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Be sure to read and understand the [ID service requirements](../reference/requirements.md) before getting started with these procedures.

## Standard implementation

A standard implementation uses [Adobe Exprience Platform Launch](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/launch/using/home.html) to help you get started with the ID service and integrate it with other Experience Cloud solutions. We strongly recommend that you use Experience Platform Launch when implementing the ID service.
